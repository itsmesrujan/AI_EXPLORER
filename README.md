__AI-Powered AI Concept Explorer - A Desktop Based Application__

This application is developed to demonstrate various AI/ML concepts.

_[More detail specification including code/technical documentation is in progress]_

__Instructions to run__
1. Download the project.
2. Install the supporting packages as far as your operating system is concerned.
    - For instance, I have installed these packages using `pip3` command as shown below.
    - `pip3 install PySide6` ..
3. Navigate to the project folder of AI_EXPLORER.
4. Launch the application from your terminal with the command below.
    - `python3 main.py`
5. Run tests
